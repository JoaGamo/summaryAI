# What is this?
This is a project designed to host a WebUI to share my university notes (in markdown) to my colleagues. 
The idea was to show my personal notes and generate with AI a summary for each note, everything contained in a website.
Project abandoned, no time to develop and afford hosting an AI LLM every day.
# Why was it abandoned?
Hosting a cheap AI, <7B models, costs a fair amount of computing, the purpose doesn't justify dedicating a server for this task.
The challenge imposed in this project was creating it using 100% AI, trying myself to not be involved in writing any code of it. It worked great :)
