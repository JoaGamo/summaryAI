# summaryAI
Project abandoned as of now, no time to develop and afford hosting an AI LLM
# What is this?
This is a project designed to host a WebUI to share my university notes (in markdown) to my colleagues. 
The idea was to show my personal notes and generate with AI a summary for each note, everything contained in a website.
# Why was it abandoned?
Hosting a cheap AI, <7B models, costs a fair amount of computing for me. Even if I pre-generate the summaries it's still computing that is more useful in other tasks in my server.
The challenge imposed in this project was creating it using 100% AI, trying myself to not be involved in writing any code of it. Tbh it worked great :)
